## Maintainer Notes

It is recommended that the template files in this directory are used to provide copyright and
license declarations in the source files in this repository.   To ease this task, the core
license and copyright text are separated from the per filetype rubric which takes account
of variations in comment syntax.

Note that comment syntax for markdown is a tricky technical issue.
